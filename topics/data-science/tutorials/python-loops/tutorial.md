A *for loop* tells Python to execute some statements once for each value in a list, a character string, or some other collection: "for each thing in this group, do these operations"

It may be less clear here, since you just need to do one operation (`print`) but if you had to do two operations, three, more?

## Structure

## A `for` loop is made up of a collection, a loop variable, and a body.

```python
for number in [2, 3, 5]:
    doubled = number * 2
    print(f"{number} doubled is {doubled}")
```

- `number` - this is the loop variable. It's a new variable, that's assigned to the values from the collection.
- the collection, `[2, 3, 5]` is a `list` of numbers which we can tell from the square brackets used: `[`, `]`
- the loop body, where we double a number and the print out a message. The loop body is what gets executed for every iteration of the loop.

> > ### {% icon code-out %} What's really happening internally

> > # Second iteration, number = 3
> > doubled = number * 3
> > print(f"{number} doubled is {doubled}")
> > # Third iteration, number = 5
> > doubled = number * 5
> > print(f"{number} doubled is {doubled}")
> > ```
> {: .code-out}
{: .code-2col}

Writing loops saves us time and makes sure our code is accurate, that we don't accidentally introduce a typo somewhere in the loop body.


## Indentation

The first line of the `for` loop must end with a colon, and the body must be indented.

> ### {% icon tip %} Tip: Blocks in Python

> if x > 10:
>     print(x)

>     if x > 10:

> ```

{: .tip}

The indentation is in fact, quite necessary. Notice how this fails:

```python
for number in [2, 3, 5]:
print(number)
```

And, likewise, this:

```python
patient1 = "z2910"
  patient2 = "y9583"
```

```python
# This code accidentally lost it's indentation! Can you fix it?
data = [1, 3, 5, 9]
acc = 0
for i in data:
if i < 4:
acc = acc + i * 2
else:
acc = acc + i
print(f'The value at {i} is {acc}')
print(f'The answer is {acc}')
```

## Variable Naming

Loop variables can be called anything, `i`, `j`, and `k` are very commong defaults due to their long history of use in other programing languages.
As with all variables, loop variables are: Created on demand, and Meaningless; their names can be anything at all.

```python
for kitten in [2, 3, 5]:
    print(kitten)
```

But *meaningless* is bad for variable names, and whenever possible, we should strive to pick useful, accurate variable names that help use remember what's going on:

```
for sequence in sequences:
    print()
for patient in clinic_patients:
    print()
for nucleotide in dna_sequence:
    print()
```

## Range

You can use `range` to iterate over a sequence of numbers. This is a built in function (check `help(range)`!) so it's always available even if you don't `import` anything. The range produced is non-inclusive: `range(N)` is the numbers `0` to `N-1`, so the result will be exactly the length you requested.

```python
for number in range(3):
    print(number)
```

However in python `range` is a special type of iterable: none of the numbers are created until we need them.

```python
print(range(5))
print(range(-3, 8)[0:4])
```

The easiest way to see what numbers are actually in there is to convert it to a `list`:

```python
print(list(range(5)))
print(list(range(-3, 8)))
print(list(range(0, 10, 2)))
```

## Accumulation

In programming you'll often want to accumulate some values: counting things (or "accumulating"). The pattern consists of creating a variable to store your result, running a loop over some data, and in that loop, adding to the variable for your result.

```python
# Sum the first 10 integers.
total = 0
for number in range(1, 11):
    total = total + (number)
print(total)
```

But how did we get that result? We can add some "debugging" lines to the above code to figure out how we got to that result. Try adding the following line in the above loop

```
print(f'Currently {number}, our total is {total}')
```

You can add it before you update `total`, after it, or both! Compare the outputs to understand what's happening on each line.
